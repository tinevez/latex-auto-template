% LaTeX is a really nice document processing tool that can produce beautiful articles, preprints, manuals, reports, \textit{etc}.
% Here we introduced a GitHub template repository that automated the compilation and deployment of the document produced by LaTeX in this repository, thanks to GitHub actions.

% \section*{Introduction}

% Since the advent of the bioRxiv hosting platform in 2013, the production of preprints became a common practice in Biology-related fields.
% This initiative fostered what was first a cautious interests from these fields~\cite{Callaway2012}.
% The bioRxiv platform quickly entered exponential growth soon after its launch~\cite{Callaway2013} and in 2018, there have been more than 2000 preprints uploaded each month~\cite{Abdill2019}.
% Nowadays preprints in Biology seem to be used more to establish precedence~\cite{Vale2016} and facilitate dissemination than to foster collaborative reviews~\cite{Anderson2020}.
% They also have been shown to have a positive impact on citation and exposure~\cite{Abdill2019, Fraser2019}.

% The production of documents to be published as preprints has become therefore a common task of many researchers.
% While unedited, unformatted word documents should suffice, a more visually pleasing document will ease the reading of the preprint and be subjectively better valued by its readership.
% But this requires a supplemental effort from the author, which is classically handled by a journal edition team after article acceptance.

% Despite its old age, LaTeX~\cite{Lamport1994} is still a favourite document processing of many scientists, even in Biology-related fields.
% It can typeset content in documents with a quality that matches the production of professional editing teams.
% One of us recently created a document class for LaTeX specifically made for scientific publications~\cite{HenriquesPreprintTemplate}.
% LaTeX offers others advantages.
% Because it relies on plain text files to produce the document, it fits very well with the version control tools and continuous integration practices that are found in software development.
% Several platforms offer source code hosting with version control~\cite{SourceForge, Mercurial, GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab}, and include collaboration  and continuous integration facilities. 
% Continuous integration \TODO

% GitHub~\cite{GitHub} is such a platform, and is used frequently for the development of academic open-source software, for instance in the bioimage analysis domain~\cite{FijiPaper, IcyPaper, ImgLib2Paper}.
